VALUE ASSESSMENT
CONTRACT EVALUATION
His $55M AAV is currently tied for 2nd-highest in the NFL (with Josh Allen, Trevor Lawrence, and Joe Burrow), trailing only Dak Prescott ($60M). This reflects "Top 5" market value, placing immense pressure on consistent elite production.

TRADE VALUE
Extremely High. As a 27-year-old franchise QB in his prime, he would likely command a package starting with three 1st-round picks and additional premium assets.

FREE AGENT MARKET VALUE (if applicable)
If hitting the open market in 2026, he would easily reset the market or match the $55M–$60M AAV range given the rising salary cap and shortage of Tier 1 starters.

PLAYER COMPARISONS
Similar Players (Style/Value Tier):

Trevor Lawrence - Similar contract bracket and career arc; both are high-pedigree young starters tasked with elevating talented but inconsistent rosters.

Matthew Stafford - Shares the "elite arm talent" profile with the ability to make high-difficulty throws from various arm angles and platforms.

Dak Prescott - Comparison based on value tier and the "franchise stabilizer" role, though Love offers more vertical aggression in his playing style.
