Player: Jordan Love (QB, GB) Observation Date: Jan 2026 Key Insight: (Based on the Kollmann video) Love's ability to "punish" a defense that sells out to stop one guy (Watson/Reed) is his elite trait. Data to Track: Completion % vs. Man Coverage when the primary X-receiver is bracketed. Personnel Note: Love is a "Multiplier." He makes the 3rd and 4th options on the roster look like 1st options.
